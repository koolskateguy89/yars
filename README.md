# YARS - Yet Another Rust Server

## Project Overview

YARS is a lightweight server framework written from scratch in Rust. It focuses on **raw data transport, protocol parsing, and request routing**, serving as a hands-on exploration into **low-level server design**. This project is intended for learning purposes and does not implement the full feature set of mature frameworks like Actix-Web or Axum.
